# Investing-SmartContract
A smartcontract that deposits money and gives intrest each monthes to the investors using fornt-end connected to your Metamask wallet.
This project contains four files:
  1) invest.sol ==> This file contains the main solidity codes and functions that used in the app
  2) web3.min.js ==> This file allows us to make requests to an individual Ethereum node with JSON RPC in order to read and write data to the network. It's kind of like using jQuery with a JSON API to read and write data with a web server
  3) webPage.html ==> This is the main html file that will be showd for the user
  4) events.js ==> This file is the carrier of datas between the contract and front-end which written based on DOM JS
Good Luck.
